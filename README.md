# Unknown Game

I don't know what game this will be yet, but it will be made using Rust and with a custom game engine with Vulkan API.

Currently, it is a good start for a game engine for a particle-based physics game. I may come back to it at some point and see the project through, or maybe rewrite it in a different language.

Here are some really cool things that this engine does now:
* Sand spills from my cursor
* Sand falls at an increased speed with time (gravity works)
* Particles can collide with each other and exchange velocity
* Particles experience drag while traveling through the "air"
