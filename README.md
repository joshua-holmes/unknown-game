# Unknown Game

I don't know what game this will be yet, but it will be made using Rust and with a custom game engine with Vulkan API.

Currently, it is a good start for a game engine for a particle-based physics game. I may come back to it at some point and see the project through, or maybe rewrite it in a language that is better for game dev.
